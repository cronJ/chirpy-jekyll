## Introduction

Last year I purchased the new kit version of the original Prusa i3 MK2.
It finally arrived and it was worth the waiting.
I ordered the third printer only because I want to try building a printer.
Both printers I already own are already assembled ones.
So I said to me the Prusa has a bigger build volume and an interesting bed levelling function, this is a good reason to buy one ðŸ˜Š

Here are some technical specifications for the kit version I purchased:

- Build volumeÂ 25 x 21 x 20 cm
- 0,4mm nozzle
- 1,75mm filament diameter
- E3D V6 Full hot end
- PEI print surface & heat bed
- Automatic mesh bed levelling (9 points)
- Integrated control board which prints from SD card

## Build

Here are some pictures during the build.
The build was so relaxing that I totally forget to do more pictures.
Initially there was a time-lapse planned for the build, but there are already someÂ on YouTube, so I didn't make it.

For the build I didn't use the printed version of the manual.
I used the online version because of the high resolution pictures included.
I only had two small issues during the build.

Number one was the motor mount and belt holder on the Y-axis had not big enough holes to slide on the threaded rods.
I screwed the threaded rods into the parts what gave me a headache after the assembly, when I tried to correct the position of these parts.
Here I totally had to drill the holes wider first so that the parts can slide on the threaded rods.

Number two was the extruderÂ assembly.
To get this part together without M3 nuts falling out on each side was a little bit tricky ... to put it charitablyÂ ðŸ˜‰

And here is the final printer on its current position:

## Prints

I already printed some partsÂ on the new printer and the overall quality of the prints is simply awesome.
But see for yourself:

This is the 3DBenchy ([Thingyverse link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622)) which I tested with silver PLA and a layer height of 200Âµm.

This is a dual-color print which was on the SD card already.
Here the print stopped after the silver part was printed.
Then you can load new filament into the printer and extrude as much as you need to get the old colour out.
After the new colour extrudes correctly you can resume the print with one click on the control board.
This is a nice feature which I want to test more in the future.

![Stepper motor holder](/assets/img/2017/02/SteppermotorHolder.jpg)

Here is a stepper motor holder which I designed in Autodesk Fusion 360.
I scaled the part to 102% and the stepper motor slides in smoothly.
Also, the print quality is amazing.

This is the hairy lion ([Thingyverse link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2007221)) in silver PLA.

It came out beautifully.

## Conclusion

So, I love the new Prusa i3 mk2 and I will print many things which doesn't fit on the print bed of my Lulzbot Mini.
But the Lulzbot Mini will be used also.
Both machines are nice for starting a print and coming back later for the finished part.
I can now use my box full of 1,75mm PLA from my first printer with the Prusa and print my 3mm HIPS with the Lulzbot.
So no longer unused filament lying in the basement.
