I got an E-Mail for my old Winamp Skin.
The sender asked me if I had it because he wants to use it again.
At this time I wasn't any more aware I made a skin for Winamp2.

After a quick search on my hard drive I found the SimpleOne Skin.
Because I still like it, I decided to place it on my website.

## Skin details

The SimpleOne Skin is designed for the Winamp2 player.
Version 1.0 of the skin skins the following windows:

- Player (Maximized and minimized)
- Playlist (Maximized and minimized)

Version 1.1 of the skin adds an equalizer window.
The mini browser is not included in version 1.1.
