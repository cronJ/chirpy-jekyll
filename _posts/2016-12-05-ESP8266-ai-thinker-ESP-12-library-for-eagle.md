## Introduction

Started working on a little ESP8266 project again.
This time with an ESP-12 module from Ai-Thinker.
For that I created a new part in Eagle after the specifications from Ai-Thinker ([Technical Specifications](http://wiki.ai-thinker.com/lib/exe/fetch.php/modules/esp-12_wifi.pdf)).

My purchased module has a slightly different silkscreen as shown in the document.
On my module GPIO4 and GPIO5 are swapped, and pin EN is labelled CH_PD.
That should be checked before using the part.
