After planting a few new plants in my aquarium, I took a picture of it.

Ten days later the plants had time to grow.

Additionally, there are some new fishes in the aquarium.
For the upper and middle part I now have 12 `Danio margaritatus` which have beautiful orange colored fins.
And there are 18 `Harlequin rasbora` with a black patch on their body.
Both can live peacefully together with my shrimps.

On the bottom we have `Corydoras sterbai` and `Ancistrus cirrhosus`.

The `Ancistrus cirrhosus` had produced offspring.
And this time some of them lived long enough.
