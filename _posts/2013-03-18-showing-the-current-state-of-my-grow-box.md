Because the gallery in the older post is getting full, here is the new one.
The `grow box` is now almost full, but the weather allows for no expansion of the plants.
I'm not sure in which medium I will store the plants when they will place in the garden.

Here is the state of the box on the 09. March 2013:

And here is the current state of the plants:

Root growth looks good.

Flower looks good too.
