## Who am I and what I do for a living

Hi, I'm Alex. I use this website to document my ideas, my photos and other stuff I'm interested in.
Maybe someone else finds it is interesting.

I have done an apprenticeship as an energy electronics technician for operating technology.
After that I got a bachelor of engineering.
During my studies I worked for an automotive supplier where I could write my bachelor thesis.
Currently, I work as a hardware development engineer for an automotive supplier.

In my work I'm focused on developing data acquisition systems and emulation hardware for `hardware in the loop` tester.
This involves a lot of interesting topics like:

- Hardware development (from schematic to PCB to hardware)
- Software development (C, Assembly, Python)
- Working with AMD SoCs consisting of FPGA and ARM processors (VHDL)
- GitHub workflows for automated manufacturing data from ECAD releases (I love the new KiCad CLI)
- MCAD for case and part creation

## Content and interests

The content on this website will depend on what I'm currently interested in.
This will very likely be something what has to do anything with technology.
Currently, I do a little bit with home automation.
But for me a "smart home" is something I don't even notice.
Everything has too works behind the scene.
Telling my home with an app or via voice recognition what it has to do is not really smart for me.
So I try to keep it simple and automate only tasks which I otherwise have to do over and over again.

I also like to take pictures, so there will be a few of them too.

Some time ago I got my first 3D printer.
Now I have three.
They are a useful tool for me like a hammer or a screwdriver.

And I love it green.
So I have a bunch of indoor plants and in my new home I finally have a garden.
Some content will be over this topic.
